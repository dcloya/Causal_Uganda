# Causal_Uganda
Code for the final project of the course "Introduction to Causal Inference", entitled "Entrepreneurship in Uganda".

It has been provided in two formats; an RStudio project and an interactive Jupyter notebook.

If you have the `conda` package manager, e.g. via Miniconda or Anaconda, you can create a virtual environment with all of the dependencies for the code installed, by running in the terminal (with pwd `Causal_Uganda`):

```
conda env create -f virtual_environment.yaml
```

Then, to activate this virtual environment, input into the terminal:

```
conda activate causal_uganda
```

Now you have all of the dependencies for this project installed. To run the code, do one of the following:

## Jupyter Notebook

```
jupyter notebook ./report/Notebook.ipynb
```

## RStudio

```
conda install RStudio
RStudio
```

Then, from within the RStudio GUI, open the file `Causal_1_Uganda.Rproj`.
