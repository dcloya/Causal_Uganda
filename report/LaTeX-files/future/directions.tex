In future work we would like to investigate the differences in effectiveness, if any, between the hard-skills and soft-skills training. For the purposes of this initial analysis, we pooled both treatment pools into a single group. However, understanding the differences between the two treatment modes would have real policy implications: most existing entrepreneurship training programs only employ hard-skills training. Governments interested in effectively training their entrepreneurs would like to know whether hard-skills training, soft-skills training, or a combination of both, is most likely to improve the economic outcomes of the trainees. This was a question we completely neglected in the present analysis.\\
