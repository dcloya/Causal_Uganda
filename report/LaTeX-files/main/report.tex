“Youth unemployment remains a serious policy challenge in many sub-Saharan African countries, including Uganda. In 2013, youth (aged 15 to 24) in sub-Saharan Africa were twice likely to be unemployed compared to any other age cohort. ”
“A large population of Ugandans are underemployed i.e. being either highly skilled but working in low paying jobs or working part time. ”

\section{Background}
\label{cha:backgr-quest-quest}

Uganda, like most low-income countries, has a large share of youth who are either unemployed or underemployed. Living in economies where employment opportunities are scarce and self-employment is often the only option, youth need the right combination of human, financial, and social capital to improve their welfare. Younger people are often the largest demographic segment in these countries, which means that their well-being has especially important ramifications for the overall state of their countries' economies.\\

Many governments recognize that their economy would benefit from better-trained entrepreneurs. Uganda and 22 other African countries have mainstreamed entrepreneurship training in high school through support from the International Labor Organization (ILO). Other countries are developing short training programs in entrepreneurship, while yet other countries are expanding university level entrepreneurship training. However, the curricula in all of these programs are based primarily on hard skills and ignore the potential contributions of soft skills to improved economic outcomes.\\

This proposed research seeks to address a gap in development literature by focussing on which specific business training techniques work. There have been a number of experimental business training evaluation studies including Karlan and Valdivia (2011)\cite{karlanAndValdivia2011} and Valdivia (2011)\cite{valdivia2011} in Peru, Drexler et al. (2014)\cite{drexler2014} in the Dominican Republic, Berge et al. (2011)\cite{berge2011} in Tanzania. These studies confirm that business training leads to improvements in knowledge of good business practices. However, these studies examine the impact of training on existing entrepreneurs. In Sri Lanka de Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff (2012)\cite{deMelEtAl2012} examine the effects of an ILO business training program on business success of both existing female entrepreneurs and the general population of women. The proposed project wishes to expand on this research. \\

More specifically, we want to investigate if entrepreneurial training affects labor market outcomes by a) inducing individuals to start businesses sooner after graduation of secondary school and b) increasing revenues and profits for those businesses. We measure business creation and financial performance in a sample of 3,893 Ugandans between 22-30 years old who were eligible to receive a three-week, post-secondary intensive training camp on entrepreneurship skills. We will study economic outcomes of individuals under a non-parametric framework to estimate their treatment-specific counterfactual outcomes. We hope to answer the following questions:\\

\begin{itemize}
\item Does entrepreneurial training (of any kind) increase the likelihood of starting a business after graduation from high school?
\item Does entrepreneurial training (of any kind) increase business monthly revenue?
\item Does entrepreneurial training (of any kind) increase business monthly profit?
\end{itemize}

All of the economic outcomes listed above are proxies for the success of entrepreneurial training in improving the welfare of young persons who might otherwise be unemployed or underemployed. For the purposes of this initial analysis, we will pool both treatment arms (hard-skills and soft-skills) into a single group, thereby ignoring any potential differences between the two types of training..\\


\section{Experimental Design}
\label{cha:data-exper-descr}

We interviewed 4,400 individuals at baseline, and we reached 3,891 during the follow-up study 4 years after. Our baseline covariates $W_0$ include basic sociodemographic characteristics such as age, gender, region of residence, and household socio-economic level; several measures of cognitive development, e.g. Raven score; personality constructs (Big 5); and time and risk preferences. Distance from home village to training site was also recorded for all individuals. We observe treatment status $A$ labeled as $A=0$ for no treatment and $A = 1$ for treatment. At follow-up, we obtained information about every economic activity undertaken in the period after graduation from high school and time of the follow-up interview (April 2016). Our outcomes $Y$ are (1) a binary indicator for whether the individual started a business, (2) the logarithm of monthly revenue measured in USD, and (3) the logarithm of monthly profit measured in USD. Note that outcomes (2) and (3) only apply to those individuals who actually started a business.\\

The target population was youth in Uganda who graduated high school and are in the job market. The sample consisted of students enrolled in the last year of high school in 4 regions of Uganda in 2013. Approximately, $40\%$ of the sample attended schools in the West, $20\%$ in Jinja, $20\%$ in Mbale, and $20\%$ in the North. The study was designed to be nationally representative with both students and teachers assigned to one of three groups (hard skills, soft skills, control) randomly. Students were recruited from $200$ secondary schools, which represents a third of the total number of full time secondary schools in Uganda. Students interested in the program were asked to fill out an application form and a baseline survey. In total $8,080$ students applied to the program and of those $7,431$ complied with eligibility requirements (completeness of key baseline characteristics and no concurrent entrepreneurship or business training). \\

Power calculations showed that $1,200$ students per arm were required, but sample size was incremented to account for attrition. We drew a random sample of $4,400$ students out of the eligible pool of $7,421$. Then, $1,600$ students were randomly assigned to hard skills training, $1,600$ students were randomly assigned to soft skills, and $1,200$ students were randomly assigned to the control group. At each step of the sampling process we stratified by both school and gender to avoid confounding and ensure a well-balanced design.\\

A two-arms intervention was implemented: a 3-week intensive entrepreneurship camp with a strong emphasis on (1) soft skills and (2) hard skills. All students had a basic overview entrepreneurship and worked on a business plan during the 3-week course. The intervention was implemented in May 2013. \\

Students in the hard skills program focused on financial decision making, while the soft skills arm focused on abilities such as negotiation and communication. The curricula for the training was designed by the International Labor Organization and the Haas Business School.\\

Teachers were recruited, hired and trained by Educate! a non-profit organization. Teachers were randomly assigned to training site, school and classroom. Each of the 20 host schools was staffed with 3 teachers: 2 regular curriculum instructors (hard or soft skills), who both taught the regular curriculum, and 1 instructor who taught the business plan curriculum exclusively. Assignment was stratified by language and ability. The principal investigators of this study are Paul Gertler and Dana Carney at UC Berkeley.\\

Treatment was assigned randomly, i.e. using a random number generator. This was for identifiability of results.\\

Overall about one-third of the study participants are female. On average, those taking part in the study are $20$ years old.\\

The sample was balanced across all 3 arms of the study (no treatment, soft-skills treatment, and hard skills treatment). $9$ of $144$ p-values were less than $0.10$. The characteristics of the teachers were balanced as well. Of everyone assigned to treatment (hard- or soft-skills), $67.4\%$ participated in the training. None of the controls participated in the training. Our sample consists of $1,021$ controls, $1,448$ individuals assigned to \textit{hard} skills, and $1,422$ individuals assigned to \textit{soft} skills. Roughly $2/3$ of the sample started a business during the recall period, and average monthly revenues and profits were $957$ and $501$ USD (adjusted for purchasing power parity, PPP).\\


\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:antic-chall}

Even though assignment to treatment was randomized, compliance with treatment was not perfect (i.e. not every individual assigned to treatment attended the training). Moreover, we were able to reach approximately c$88\%$ of the original sample in the follow-up interview. Therefore, estimation of causal effects in this setting entails dealing with a potential selection problem, because individuals who did not attend the training, or individuals who were lost to follow-up could differ in observable and unobservable characteristics correlated with the outcomes. Fortunately, we have baseline covariates of those were lost to follow-up for the original $4,400$ individuals. By fully utilizing all the available baseline covariates, our aim is to estimate a double robust locally efficient substitution estimator that will be consistent and asymptotically linear if the selection mechanism is consistently estimated or if we can treat assignment to treatment and attrition as independent events (i.e. no differential attrition between treatment and control).\\

An empirical strategy to deal with this censoring issue is to model assignment to treatment $A$ and attrition $\Delta$ as a single intervention node by estimating its joint distribution $f_{A,\Delta}(A,\Delta)$.


\section{Causal Analysis}
\label{sec:caus-analys-exper}

For each of the three outcomes, the target causal parameter is the Average Treatment Effect, which is the difference in the expected counterfactual if all recruited students had taken the entrepreneurial training and the expected counterfactual if none of the students were assigned to the treatment.

\[ \Psi^{\mathcal{F}}(\mathbb{P}_{U,X}) = \mathbb{E}_{U,X}(Y_1) - \mathbb{E}_{U,X}(Y_0)  \]

Because of the design of the experiment as an RCT (randomized control trial), we can conclude that $A$ is a function of $U_A$ only, so that there must be an exclusion restriction between $W$ and $A$. See p. 24 of \cite{tlb} for confirmation of this claim. A second consequence of our randomizing the intervention node $A$ is that we may assume that $U_A$ is independent of $U_Y$ and of $U_W$. We can test this assumption for $U_A$ and $U_W$ by using a balance table. There is no way for us to test the independence assumption of $U_A$ and $U_Y$. This corresponds to believing that there are no unmeasured factors that predict both $A$ and the outcome $Y$, which is often called the no unmeasured confounders assumption. This independence assumption also means that there is no backdoor path from $Y$ to $A$. Therefore our causal estimand is identifiable from the statistical estimand. Our structural causal assumes that the observed data were generated by the following actions: \\

\begin{enumerate}
\item Drawing unobservable $U=(U_A, U_Y, U_W)$ from some probability distribution $\probability_U$ ensuring that $U_A$ is independent of $U_Y$, given $W$.
\item Generating $W$ as a deterministic function of $U_W$.
\item Generating $A$ as a deterministic function of $W$ and $U_A$.
\item Generating $Y$ as a deterministic function of $W$, $A$, and $U_Y$.
\end{enumerate} 

The time ordering of the variables is $W \to A \to Y$, while for the causal ordering, both $W$ and $A$ precede $Y$, and neither $W$ nor $A$ precede each other. This model is illustrated in the figure \ref{fig:DAG}. Note that there are no assumptions on functional forms in our model. Nevertheless, because of the randomization of $U_A$ via a random number generator with a specified distribution, our model is technically speaking only semi-parametric, and not completely non-parametric.\\

\section{Future Directions}
\label{sec:future-directions}

In future work we would like to investigate the differences in effectiveness, if any, between the hard-skills and soft-skills training. For the purposes of this initial analysis, we pooled both treatment pools into a single group. However, understanding the differences between the two treatment modes would have real policy implications: most existing entrepreneurship training programs only employ hard-skills training. Governments interested in effectively training their entrepreneurs would like to know whether hard-skills training, soft-skills training, or a combination of both, is most likely to improve the economic outcomes of the trainees. This was a question we completely neglected in the present analysis.
